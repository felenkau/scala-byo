# Scala BYO

Small tips & tricks I use in my code.
They're rarely something big, more like concepts or small useful code snippets that you can bring to almost every project without major changes. That's why I call it _BYO_ code. 

I mainly work with Scala/Spark, therefore most of the examples will go from there.

Enjoy :)
